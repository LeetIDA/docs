# What is CS Notes?

The personal red teaming notes of a cybersecurity student. You can find publicly accessible resources at [https://docs.l337.cc](./) ,

Here, a passionate student explores the exciting realm of pentesting and red teaming.

This controlled environment will provide you with a treasure trove of experiments, insights, and observations involving penetration testers, red teams, and real-world adversaries using various tools and techniques. Hands-on experience, meticulous documentation, and a relentless curiosity are the pillars of learning for this cyber enthusiast.

These notes will provide an in-depth look at offensive security techniques, from code execution and injection to lateral movement and persistence while evading defenses. A security researcher often builds these techniques on the shoulders of other diligent security researchers. Even though this student does not claim ownership of most of these techniques, he or she acknowledges and references their sources as often as possible.

Join this educational journey of discovery and experimentation in the exciting field of cybersecurity.
